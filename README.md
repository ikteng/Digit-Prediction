# Digit-Prediction

This program uses Pytorch to create a model using the datasets.MNIST from torchvision. The model is then used to predict the digit in the image.

mnist_digit_classifier.pth is the saved, trained model
For testing, img_1 to img_4 is provided.
img_5 contains more than 1 digit in the image, however still unable to predict the digits correctly.

Things to be improved:
1. able to predict more than 1 digit in the image correctly (in progress)
2. able to predict digits in real time
